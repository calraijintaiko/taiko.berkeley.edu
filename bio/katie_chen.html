<span>Biography:</span>
After being introduced to it by a friend during high school, Katie decided to try out for taiko completely on a whim. Ever since, she hasn't been able to get taiko off her mind and has come a long way because of it. In her spare time, Katie likes to draw, read comics, play old-school video games, and pretend that she can sing and play guitar (she also really wants to learn the bass guitar). Katie also likes mornings and geeky graphic tees and is unconsciously very superstitious. <br /><br />
