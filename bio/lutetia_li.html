<span>Biography:</span>
 Lutetia never really knew what taiko was until this summer when her music 26AC teacher played
a short clip of Caltaiko performing. Then she actually saw them practicing on Sproul (never thought people on youtube
are actually real) and decided that she has to go to the auditions. Lutetia is often confused when people ask for her name and where 
she is from but you can still ask her and she will give you the answers happily. Although she is not sure about a lot of things, there 
are two things that she is absolutely sure of, coming to Berkeley and joining Cal Raijin Taiko. Go Bears!
