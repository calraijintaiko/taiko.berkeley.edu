<span>Biography:</span>
Quinn's pursuit for Taiko began during his first visit of Berkeley on Cal Day his senior year of high school. Upon waking up to the sounds of Don's, Quinn decided to go to Lower Sproul to check out the commotion. That was the first time he was ever exposed to Taiko drumming & Cal Raijin Taiko. Never before had he seen such organized, energetic, and passionate sexiness. Since then, Quinn was determined to join the Cal Raijin Taiko family.
<br />
Outside of playing Taiko, Quinn enjoys baking, sailing, designing, hacking, and relaxing. One of Quinn's life long goals has been to start a bakery.<br /><br />
<span>Favorite Quotes:</span> <br />
"I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 600 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life... and that is why I succeed."
<br />-Michael Jordan
<br /><br />
"A goal is a dream with a deadline."
<br />-Napoleon Hill</p>
