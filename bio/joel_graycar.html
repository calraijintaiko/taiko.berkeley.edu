<span>Biography:</span>
Joel was forced into doing taiko at the tender age of 10 by his father, who was determined to drag him away from his video games. He and his brother joined the San Francisco Taiko Dojo, and ended up having a great time for the next eight years. Knowing for sure that he wanted to continue doing taiko while in college, he was excited to come try out for the Cal taiko team as soon as possible with long-time taiko friend Kristen Chinn. Besides taiko Joel used to do cross-country and track, but since going to college he runs about as often he eats his fruits and vegetables (probably not as often as he should). Instead, you can find him playing his Vita or wasting away the hours in the far, weird reaches of the Internet.
