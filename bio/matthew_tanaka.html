<span>Biography:</span>
Matthew joined Cal Taiko with no musical experience whatsoever. He learned
 about Cal Taiko his freshman year through his best friend Ivana Kim, who
  joined in 2010, but he did not have the courage to tryout until a year
   later.  In addition to taiko, Matthew’s interests include skiing, cooking,
    finding delicious eateries, playing and watching sports, and discovering
     new music.  However, he dislikes cilantro and people who don’t use their
      turn signal.  His favorite TV shows are Top Gear, Man v. Food, and
       Saturday Night Live, and he was born and raised a San Francisco 49er
        fan.  He also supports other Bay Area sports teams including the
         San Francisco Giants, San Jose Sharks, Golden State Warriors, and
          of course, your California Golden Bears!<br />
