<span>Biography:</span>
Clifford likes long-distance running and exploring the city in his free time. One day, he hopes to run a marathon, but for now, he's just trying to increase his endurance. When he is not on the move, he  enjoys eating. If you ever see him on campus, he will probably be holding a drink or a snack in his hand. Clifford tried out for Cal Raijin Taiko because he always loved to drum, but never took the opportunities that came his way. Now he is part of Cal Taiko, not only can he improve his drumming, but he can embrace a new culture and family!<br /><br />
