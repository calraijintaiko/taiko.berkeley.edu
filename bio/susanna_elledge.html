<span>Biography:</span>
Susanna first saw a taiko performance at a graduation during her junior year. She was blown away by the power and energy from the performers. Wanting to take part in this excitement and find out more about her grandfather's Japanese culture, she looked into playing with the Genki Spark, a new all female taiko group in Boston. There she began her taiko career. She was sad to leave her taiko family when she had to move away for college but was excited to hear that Cal had a group. After seeing them perform at Calapalooza she knew she wanted to be a part of the Raijin family. And now she is suuuppper happy to be playing with Cal Raijin Taiko!!
<br /><br />Outside of taiko she loves to ride bikes, develop pictures, adventure into SF, take road trips, and eat delicious food!!<br />

<span>Favorite Quotes:</span> <br />
“To make a resolution and act accordingly is to live with hope. There may be difficulties and hardships, but not disappointment or despair if you follow the path steadily. Do not hurry. This is a fundamental rule. If you hurry and collapse or tumble down, nothing is achieved. DO not rest in your efforts; this is another fundamental rule. Without stopping, without haste, carefully taking a step at a time forward will surely get you there.” 
<br/>-Shinichi Suzuki<br /><br />
