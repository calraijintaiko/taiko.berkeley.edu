<span>Biography:</span>
Arianne was first exposed to taiko performance at the Cherry Blossom Festival
 in San Jose. She thought it was extremely awesome at the time, but was never
 near enough to any taiko groups to try it out for herself! She was later
 shanghaied into trying out for Cal Raijin Taiko by a friend and fellow team
 member, and was (by some miracle) accepted on to the team. Her arms have
 developed extremely attractive guns thanks to this miracle, and she has
 thoroughly enjoyed honing them and flaunting them in front of the mirror.
 Other hobbies include playing cello, theater, and being a dork.<br />
