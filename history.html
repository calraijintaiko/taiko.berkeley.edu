<div class="center"><h3>History of Taiko</h3><br /></div>
	  <div class="info">

<p id="info" align="justify">Taiko, though primarily known as a modern Japanese art form, contains both an ancient and a modern
history.<br /><br />
Taiko, which literally means "drum" in Japanese, stem back over 1000 years in Japan.  They were originally used
as military instruments and as a time keeper for daily village life.  As a result of its importance in Japanese
culture, Taiko also came to be associated with religious activities.  In later periods, the Taiko was played as
a centerpiece at festivals, or Matsuri. <br /><br />
Modern Taiko, as it is known today in its ensemble (Kumi-daiko) art form, dates back only half a century to the
post war Jazz musician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daihachi_Oguchi" target="_blank">Daihachi Oguchi</a>.
  Oguchi was the first artist to bring Taiko together in an ensemble format, using multiple drums and rhythms
  within a single arrangement.  When the Japanese government established funds aimed at the preservation of
  Japanese culture, a reaction against increasing Western influence in Japan, Taiko groups began forming all
  throughout the country.  The most notable of these groups, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondekoza" target="_blank">Za Ondekoza</a>, and later <a href="http://www.kodo.or.jp/" target="_blank">Kodo</a>,
have gone on to attain world recognition.<br /><br />
Taiko was brought to North America in 1968 by Grand Master
<a href="http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/interviews/profiles/20/" target="_blank">Seiichi Tanaka</a> and the
founding of America's first Kumi-Daiko ensemble, <a href="http://www.sftaiko.com/" target="_blank">San Francisco Taiko Dojo</a>.
Since then, hundreds of ensembles have been established across the U.S. and Canada, many of which trace their
beginnings directly back to San Francisco Taiko Dojo.  Other early North American Taiko pioneers were Kinnara Taiko
in Los Angeles, <a href="http://www.taiko.org/main.html" target="_blank">San Jose Taiko</a>, and
<a href="http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/interviews/profiles/43/" target="_blank">Kenny Endo</a>'s
<a href="http://www.taikoarts.com/" target="_blank">Taiko Center of the Pacific</a> in Honolulu.<br /><br />
Since its origins 40 years ago, North American Taiko has taken off as a popular art form, fusing traditional
drumming with many modern styles of music.  Its power and dynamism has inspired the establishment of hundreds of
groups across the continent.  With the recent popularity Taiko has gained on college campuses, many collegiate
groups have formed at universities throughout the country beginning with the first collegiate group,
<a href="http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/kyodo/" target="_blank">Kyodo Taiko</a>, at UCLA in 1990.  While there now exist many
different techniques and styles of Taiko amongst the numerous groups across North America, each ensemble shares
the same love of the art form and strives to spread the excitement and joy of drumming to audiences everywhere.
