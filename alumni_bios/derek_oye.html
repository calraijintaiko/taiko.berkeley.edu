<span>Biography:</span>
Derek saw taiko for the first time at Senshin Buddhist Temple with Kinnara Taiko, but it wasn't until college he considered playing.  With no prior musical experience, he decided to try out for Cal Taiko his freshman year and has enjoyed learning the Japanese Art form ever since.  Derek likes running, tennis, the beach, and hanging with his fraternity brothers or taiko teammates in his spare time.  Currently studying abroad in Japan, he can't wait to start playing with Cal Raijin Taiko again in the Spring.
