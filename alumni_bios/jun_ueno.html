<span>Biography:</span>
Jun had seen and heard taiko when he was in Obon Festival in Japan, however he had never seen actual kumidaiko 
performance until he saw Cal Raijin Taiko performance at Cal appaloosa in his first semester after transferred 
from college.  He was already determined joining taiko club at campus prior to transfer from community college, 
but he became absolutely sure to join the team after their powerful and fabulous performance.  Besides taiko, 
Jun enjoys playing drum set and learning new culture through traveling.  He is also obsessed by language, so he 
speaks Japanese and Spanish. He is usually described as natural comedian (whether good or not many laugh at him 
even though he is not acting funny).<br />
