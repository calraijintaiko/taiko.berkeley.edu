<span>Biography:</span>
Ryan began taiko with Daion Taiko of Orange County Buddhist Church in Anaheim, CA after his mother dragged him out to temple at 8am one fine Sunday morning, to hear the powerful rhythms at taiko practice.  After 8 years with Daion, he came to Cal a sad freshman since his friends told him there was no taiko group here.  In the first week of classes, he learned a new group had been established just a year before, jumping at the opportunity to be in the first tryout class.  Ryan likes taiko, photography, cars, awesome gadgets/technology/craftmanship, snowboarding, computers, watches, reading news blogs, and on and on.<br /><br />
