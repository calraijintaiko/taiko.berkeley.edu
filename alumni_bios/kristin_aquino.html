<span>Biography:</span>
A paragraph cannot sum up the awesomeness of Kristin. But if you must know, Kristin enjoys everything about life. She loves biking around Berkeley with no particular destination, loves dancing (the non-choreographed type), and loves hanging out with people. She wants to <i>live</i> around the world and is always looking for a change (or even better, a challenge). Though she had no previous drumming experience before joining Cal Raijin Taiko (besides randomly banging on her friend's drum set), she was drawn to the beats and sound of Cal Taiko's performance at Calapalooza 2009 and decided to try out for the group- a decision she is glad she made.

"In the first moments after death, my body will be scarcely different in physical terms than it was in the last seconds of life, but I will no longer move, no longer sense, nor speak, nor feel, nor care. It's these things that are life."<br />
<i>- Aristotle</i><br />
