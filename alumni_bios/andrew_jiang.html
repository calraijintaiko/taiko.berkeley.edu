Andrew had been exposed to taiko drumming at Mountain View Buddhist Temple, but finally joined Cal Taiko after being inspired by the group at their first annual showcase, Basebeat. Outside of taiko, Andrew’s hobbies include playing sports, rocking out to and playing music, traveling, cooking, and dabbling with Photoshop. His favorite tv shows are the Simpsons, How I Met Your Mother, Good Eats, Iron Chef America, and Sportscenter. His favorite sport is basketball, but he enjoys playing football and going snowboarding with friends up in Tahoe. A Bay Area native, Andrew’s loyalties lie with the San Francisco Giants, San Jose Sharks, San Francisco 49ers, and of course, the Cal Bears!
